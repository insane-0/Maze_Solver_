BOARD DESCRIPTION
========================
This PCB is designed for a compact autonomous maze-solving robot.
The board integrates:

- Microcontroller-based control system
- Dual DC motor driver interface
- Motor encoder input connectors
- Distance sensor connectors for wall detection
- Buck converter for regulated power supply
- Push buttons for user input
- Status LEDs for debugging and state indication

The PCB is optimized for robotics competitions and embedded system experiments.

========================
POWER DETAILS
========================
- Main Input Voltage : External battery supply
- On-board buck converter generates logic voltage
- Motor supply and logic supply are routed separately

========================
FABRICATION NOTES
========================
- Standard 2-layer PCB stackup
- All vias are plated unless otherwise specified
- No impedance-controlled traces
- No blind or buried vias
- Default solder mask opening

========================
ASSEMBLY NOTES
========================
- SMD and through-hole components are used
- Component placement follows silkscreen markings
- Polarity markings provided for connectors and LEDs

========================
IMPORTANT NOTES
========================
- This archive contains fabrication Gerber files only
- Schematic and PCB design source files are not included
